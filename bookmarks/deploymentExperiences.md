Trying to deoploy my python django weba app on Heroku was trick and frustrating , a lot of step in the chain and you are not sure if you have done something wrong on each step of the chain to break something . 

If i remember correctly deploying my react app onto heroku was much simpler

I got as far as step 6 part v of the process. I suppose that's quite far. I will watch the solution lecture and hopefully complete the process
